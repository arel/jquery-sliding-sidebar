# jQuery Sliding Sidebar

**Fixed-positioned sidebars are nice and all,** but when someone has a small screen,
or a small browser window, part of your beautiful sidebar will be obscured.
Sliding Sidebar gives you a fixed-positioned sidebar *that also gorgeously
scrolls with the page only as necessary.*

## Usage

To use with your fixed-positioned sidebar named ```#elem```

```
$('#elem').slidingSidebar();
```
